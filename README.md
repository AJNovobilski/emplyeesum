# emplyeesum

This package is a simplified version of an employee tracker. It generates an html webpage based on user input gathered from "inquier".

In the command line run 'npm install' to gather the neccessary packages. 

Then run 'node app.js' to start the application.

You will be prompted to input team member information and the html file will be appended after completing each employees information. 

Happy creating!
